# prettier4j

A Java implementation of Philip Wadler's ["A prettier printer"](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf), a pretty-printing algorithm for laying out hierarchical documents as text.

This algorithm is particularly suitable for formatting source code (see for example [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)).
